<li>Do not leave chuck wrench in chuck after removing work from chuck.</li>
<li>Keep hands off chuck rims when lathe is in motion.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to screw chuck on lathe spindle with power on, as it may get cross-threaded and cause an accident.</li>
<li>Safety-type lathe dogs shall be used when turning work on centers.</li>
<li>See that tail stock, tool holder and work are properly clamped before turning on power.</li>

<li>Do not attempt to adjust a tool while the lathe is running.</li>
<li>Operators shall not attempt to use micrometers on revolving work.</li>
  
 
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Drill Press</h3>
<li>Never attempt to hold the work under the drill by hand; clamp it securely to the table before starting the machine.</li>
<li>When tightening drill in chuck of drill press, remove release key before you start machine, or your arm may be twisted around spindle. Never leave key in chuck.</li>
<li>Use drills properly sharpened to cut to the right size.</li>
<li>Run the drill only at the correct speed; forcing or feeding too fast may cause broken drills and result in serious injury.</li>
<li>If the work should slip from clamp, never attempt to stop it with your hands. Stop the machine to make any adjustment or repair.</li>
<li>Drills, reamers, etc., must never be forced by exerting excess pressure on the feed lever. Tools may break and cause injury.</li>
 

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Milling Machines</h3>
<li>All work shall be secured properly and all loose objects removed from tables before machines are operated.</li>
<li>Cutters shall be checked for cracks or breaks before mounting and shall be securely mounted before operations are started.</li>
<li>Operators shall keep head and hands away from cutters when machine is in operation.</li>
<li>File tangs or other makeshift drifts shall not be used to remove taper shank tools. Proper drifts are available in tool rooms.</li>
<li>Safety guards shall be placed around any work item extending beyond machine table.</li>
<li>Milling cutters and other hardened tools shall not be struck with steel hammer. Blocks of wood, rawhide, or copper hammers should be used.</li>
<li>Proper feeds and speeds shall be selected before operations are started.</li>
<li>Machines shall be stopped before any attempts are made to measure or to check work.</li>
<li>Guards and baffles shall be used to protect others from flying chips, oil or coolants.</li>
<li>Operators shall be sure that cutters and feeds are turning in the proper direction so the cutters will not climb up or jam. Such an accident can cause injury to the work, the machine, and to the operator as well.
Operation and Grinders</li>
<li>Caution: All grinding wheels operate at dangerous speeds.</li>
<li>See that the grinding wheel fits easily on the spindle. It is dangerous to force it on, nor should it be too loose.</li>
<li>Washers or flange facings or compressible material shall be fitted between the wheel and its flanges. If blotting paper is used, it should not be thicker than .025 inch.</li>
<li>After a wheel is mounted, allow it to develop full operating speed; meanwhile, stand to one side and out of danger. Never apply the work until this speed test has been made and the wheel has been properly dressed. Under no condition should the wheel revolve faster than the safe R.P.M. recommended by the manufacturer as shown on the label.</li>
<li>Do not force work against a cold wheel, but apply it gradually, giving the wheel an opportunity to warm, thus reducing the chance of breakage. This applies to starting work in the mornings in cold rooms and to new wheels which have been stored in a cold place.</li>
<li>Wheel dressers, except the diamond type, shall be equipped with guards over the tops of the cutters to protect against flying pieces, broken cutters, or wheel particles.</li>
<li>Operator shall see that wheel turns freely and is properly mounted before operating.</li>
<li>All wheels should be given the "ring" test before they are mounted on machines.<br>
  Tap the wheel gently with a light nonmetallic implement, such as the handle of a screwdriver for light wheels, or a wooden mallet for heavier wheels.<br>
  If the wheel sounds cracked (dead), the wheel must be replaced. A sound and undamaged wheel will give off a clear metallic tone.<br>
  Wheels must be dry and free from sawdust when performing the ring test; otherwise, the sound will be deadened.<br>
  <img src="./images/ring_test.PNG" alt="ring test"><br><br>
  The wheels should be tapped at 45° on each side of the vertical centerline of the wheel.<br>
  Then, the wheel should be rotated 45° and the test repeated again.<br>
</li>
<li>Gloves should not be worn while operating grinders.</li>
<li>Dust collectors or other exhaust systems shall be in operation during grinding operations on machines so equipped.</li>
<li>Tools or other loose objects shall be kept off machines in operation.</li>
<li> Wheel guards shall be kept in place and in good condition while machine is in operation.</li>
<li> Safe operating speeds are marked on wheels by manufacturers.</li>
<li>Operators shall not run wheels faster than recommended speeds.</li>
<li> Operators shall avoid standing directly in front of grinding wheels, especially when starting.</li>
<li>Wheels loaded or clogged with metal shall not be used until dressed.</li>
<li>Grinding wheels out of round or out of balance shall be trued before using.</li>
<li>Eye protective equipment with side shields shall be worn while grinders are being operated.</li>
<li>Grindings wheels shall be equipped with tool rests, same must not be worn more than one-eighth inch from stone and work held firmly thereon.</li>
<li>It is unsafe to adjust a work-rest while the grinding wheel is in motion. The rest may slip and break the wheel.</li>
<li>The side of an emery wheel shall not be used for grinding unless it is a special-type wheel for that purpose.</li>
<li>Be especially careful when grinding narrow tools. They are apt to catch between the rest and the wheel.</li> 
 

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Welding</h3>
<li>All welding operations shall follow the Job Safety Rules for welding.
Personal Protective Equipment</li>
<li>Safety spectacles, either prescription or plain type, or a face shield, shall be worn on the job.</li>
<li>Work shoes (safety shoes recommended) should be worn by all machinists since handling material is an essential part of this occupation.</li>
<li>Gloves are recommended for protection in handling material but must not be worn when operating machines.</li><br>
